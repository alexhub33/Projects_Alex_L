# Description   : SQL JOIN PRACTICE


------Q1
SELECT emp.first_name+emp.last_name AS 'Employee',
man.first_name+man.last_name AS 'Manager'
FROM employees emp
JOIN
employees man
ON (man.employee_id=emp.manager_id);


----Playing with the above, this is an EXAMPLE the letters previous are subjective and are just trackers
SELECT b.first_name+b.last_name AS 'Employee',
m.first_name+m.last_name AS 'Manager'
FROM employees b
JOIN
employees m
ON (m.employee_id=b.manager_id);

------Q2
SELECT dept.department_name, dept.manager_id, loc.city
FROM departments dept 
JOIN
locations loc
ON (dept.location_id=loc.location_id);


--ON (dept.location_id=loc.location_id);  ---MISTAKE WAS NOT CHOOSING dept.location_id with loc.location_id,    location_id is the PK (Primary Key)

SELECT *
FROM departments

SELECT *
FROM locations

------Q3

SELECT c.country_name, loc.city
FROM countries c
JOIN
locations loc
ON (c.country_id=loc.country_id)

-------------------------------------------MISTAKE WHEN FIRST WRITING CODE = FORGOT TO RENAME/tagup countries c ( FROM countries c )


SELECT *
FROM countries

SELECT *
FROM locations



---------Q4
----Tricky because it wants just the manager's first name and last names.  Not all the employees
- -Explain why you matched manager ID with employee ID in on the ON line: Since there are only a finite amount of departments.  
---Departments should be viewed as the highest in the hierchy to determine number of managers.  Think about the relationship 


SELECT dept.department_name, dept.manager_id, emp.first_name, emp.last_name
FROM departments dept
JOIN
employees emp
ON (dept.manager_id=emp.employee_id)

SELECT *
FROM departments

SELECT *
FROM employees 

-------------------Q5
---Tricky because you need to set the set value of dept.location_id=1700, it's a condition

Select emp.first_name, emp.last_name
FROM employees emp
JOIN
departments dept
ON (emp.department_id=dept.department_id) 
JOIN
locations loc
ON (loc.location_id=dept.location_id)
AND 
dept.location_id=1700


-----
SELECT *
FROM employees 

Select *
FROM locations

Select *
from departments
